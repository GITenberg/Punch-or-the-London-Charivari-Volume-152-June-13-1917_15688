    <h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>

    <p>Count <span class="sc">Tisza</span> has declared his
    intention of going to the Front for the duration of the War. He
    denies, however, that he caught the idea from Mr.
    <span class="sc">Winston Churchill.</span></p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The Germans announced that Ch&eacute;risy was impregnable.
    In view of the fact that the place has since been captured by
    the British it is felt that Sir <span class="sc">Douglas
    Haig</span> could not have read the German announcement.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Owners of babies are asked to hang out flags from their
    houses during the forthcoming Baby Week at Croydon. Parents who
    have only a little Bunting should hang that out instead.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A parrot owned by a lady at Ipswich is said to make "poll
    scratchers" for herself out of small pieces of soft wood. In
    justice to the bird it must be stated that she has frequently
    expressed a desire to be allowed to do war-work, but has been
    discouraged.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A Battersea fitter has been committed for trial for breaking
    into a Kingston jeweller's and stealing goods worth
    &pound;2,350. There is really no excuse for this sort of thing,
    as the public have been repeatedly asked by the Government not
    to go in for expensive jewellery.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>An Eastbourne coal merchant told the tribunal that a
    substitute sent to him was "too dirty to cart coals." The
    department has apologised for the mistake and explained that it
    was thought the man was required to deliver milk.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>According to the <i>Berliner Tageblatt</i>, twenty-nine
    houses in Oberreuth have been burned down and a villager aged
    ninety-seven years has been arrested. The veteran, it appears,
    puts down his sudden crime to the baneful influence of the
    cinema.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>One of the latest Army Orders permits the wearing of leather
    buttons in place of brass. Our readers should not be too ready
    to assume that this will have any effect on the existing
    meat-pie shortage.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Recently published statistics of the Zoological Gardens show
    a marked decrease of mortality among the inmates since they
    were placed on rations. A nasty rumour is also laid to rest by
    the declaration that the notices which deal with "Enquiries for
    Lost Children" and are prominently displayed in the Gardens
    were actually in vogue before the rationing system was
    introduced.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Paper is one of the principal foods of "Chips," the pet goat
    of Summer-down Camp. In view of the increasing value of this
    commodity an attempt is to be made to encourage the animal to
    accept caviare instead.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"Quite good results in the sterilisation of polluted
    drinking water," says <i>The British Medical Journal</i>, "have
    been obtained by the use of sulphondichloraminobenzoic." It
    appears that you just mention this name to the germs (stopping
    for lunch in the middle) and the little beggars are scared to
    death.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>In a recent message to General
    <span class="sc">Ludendorff</span>, the
    <span class="sc">Kaiser</span> refers to the German defence as
    being "mainly in your hands." And only last April they were
    professing to find it in <span class="sc">Hindenburg's</span>
    feet.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>It is not yet compulsory under the new Order, but as a
    precaution it is advisable for the owner of a cheese to have
    his full name and address written on the collar.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The gentleman who advertised last week in a contemporary the
    loss of two pet dogs will be greatly interested in a little
    book just published, entitled <i>How to Keep Dogs</i>.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"It is the most extraordinary case I ever heard of," said
    the Chairman of the Middlesex Appeal Tribunal, in the case of a
    one-eyed man passed for general service. The case is not
    unique, however, for a one-eyed man named
    <span class="sc">Nelson</span> is recorded as having seen some
    general service in the early part of the nineteenth
    century.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Brazil has entered the War and Germany is now able to shoot
    in almost any direction without any appreciable risk of hitting
    a friend.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A five-months-old boy having been called up at Hull, the
    mother took the baby to the recruiting office, where we are
    told the military were satisfied that a mistake had been
    made.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The author of an article in <i>The Daily Mail</i> stated
    recently that nine readers of that paper had sent him poems.
    This of course is only to be expected of a newspaper which
    advocates reprisals.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>According to the <i>Vossische Zeitung</i> washing soap is
    unobtainable in Berlin. Even eating soap, it is rumoured, can
    be obtained only at prohibitive prices.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Before the Law Society Tribunal, Mr. <span class="sc">Jacob
    Epstein</span>, the sculptor, was stated to have passed the
    medical test. On the other hand Mr.
    <span class="sc">Epstein's</span> Venus is still regarded as
    medically unfit.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A Devon lady who has just celebrated her one hundredth
    birthday declares that to drink plenty of water daily is the
    secret of good health. This is a great triumph for the milk
    trade.</p>

    <h2>A SHORT WAY WITH SUBMARINES.</h2>

    <p>"A short way with submarines?" said Bill; "oh, yes, we've
    <i>got</i> one all right; but," he added regretfully, "I don't
    know as I'm at liberty to tell you. Wot I'm thinkin' about is
    this 'ere Defence o' the Realm Act&mdash;see? Why, there was a
    feller I knew got ten days' cells for just tellin' a young
    woman where 'er sweet'eart's ship was."</p>

    <p>It was the last day of Bill's "leaf," of which he had spent
    the greater part warding off the attacks of old acquaintances
    bent upon finding out something interesting about the Navy. Of
    course during his absence Bill had written home regularly, but
    his letters had been models of discretion and confined to
    matters of the strictest personal interest. Since his return
    quite a number of temporary coldnesses had arisen as a result
    of his obstinate reticence, and the retired station-master,
    after several attacks both in front and flank had ignominiously
    failed, flew into a rage and said he didn't believe there was
    any Navy left to tell about, the Germans having sunk it all at
    the Battle of Jutland.</p>

    <p>Bill said they might 'ave done, he really didn't know, not
    to be certain.</p>

    <p>But now, with his bundle handkerchief beside him, just
    having another drink on his way to the station, Bill really
    seemed to be relenting a little. The customers of the "Malt
    House" all leaned forward attentively to listen.</p>

    <p>"It's all among friends, Bill," said the landlord
    encouragingly, "it won't go no further, you can rest easy about
    that."</p>

    <p>"I've 'eard tell as it's this 'ere Mr. Macaroni," began the
    baker, who took in a twopenny paper every day, and gave himself
    well-informed airs in consequence.</p>

    <p>"If you'd ever been properly eddicated," said Bill, wiping
    his mouth on the back of his hand, "you'd know as the best
    discoveries 'ave been made by haccident, same as when the
    feller invented the steam-engine along of an apple tumblin' on
    'is 'ead. That's 'ow it is with this 'ere submarine business,
    an' no macaroni about it an' no cheese neither.</p>

    <p>"Sailormen gets a deal o' presents sent 'em nowadays,
    rangin' from wrist-watches an' cottage-pianners to woolly
    'ug-me-tights in double sennit. But the best present we ever
    'ad&mdash;well, I'll tell you.</p>

    <p>"An old lady as was aunt or godmother or something o' the
    sort to our Navigatin' Lootenant sent him a present of an extra
    large tin of peppermint 'umbugs. Real 'ot uns, they was, and
    big&mdash;well, I believe you! I've 'ad a deal o' peppermints
    in my time, but this 'ere consignment from the Navigator's
    great-aunt fairly put the lid on. You'd ha' thought all 'ands
    was requirin' dental treatment the day the Navigator shared 'em
    out, an' when the steersman come off duty, 'e give the course
    to the feller relievin' the wheel as if 'e'd got an 'ot potato
    in 'is mouth.</p>

    <p>"Well, the peppermints was in full blast an' the ship
    smellin' like a bloomin' sweet factory when the look-out
    reported a submarine on our port bow. O' course we was all
    cleared for haction, an' beginnin' to feel our Iron Crosses
    burnin' 'oles in our jumpers, when we begun to see as there was
    something funny about 'er.</p>

    <p>"Naturally we was lookin' for 'er to submerge&mdash;but not
    she! There she sat, waitin' for us, an' all 'er crew was
    pushin' an' fightin' to get their 'eads out of 'er conning
    tower. We was right on top of 'er in two twos, and all as we
    'ad to do was to pick up the officers and crew as if they was a
    lot o' wasps as 'ad been drinkin' beer, an' tow the
    submarine&mdash;which was in fust-rate goin' order, not a month
    out o' Kiel dockyard&mdash;'ome to a port as I'm not at liberty
    to mention."</p>

    <p>"But 'ow?" began the baker.</p>

    <p>"I thought as I'd made it middlin' plain," said Bill
    severely, "but seein' as some folks wants winders lettin' into
    their 'eads I suppose I'd better make it plainer. I daresay
    you've 'eard as they're very short o' sweet-stuff in
    Germany."</p>

    <p>"I 'ave," said the baker triumphantly, "I read it in my
    paper."</p>

    <p>"Well," said Bill, "there was a wind settin' good and strong
    from us towards the submarine, an' when one of 'em as 'appened
    to be takin' the air at the time got a sniff of us 'e just
    couldn't leave off sniffin'. Then 'e passed the word down to
    the others, an' the hodour of the peppermints was that powerful
    it knocked 'em all of a 'eap, the same as food on an empty
    stummnick. See? That's the real reason o' the sugar shortage.
    There's 'arf-a-dozen factories workin' night an' day on
    Admiralty contracts, turnin' out nothin' at all only peppermint
    'umbugs.</p>

    <p>"Simple, ain't it?" Bill concluded, as he paid for his beer
    and reached for his bundle. "Anyway, it does as well as
    anything else to tell a lot o' folks as can't let a decent
    sailorman spend 'is bit o' leaf in peace an' quietness without
    tryin' to get to know what 'e's got no business to tell 'em nor
    them to find out."</p>

    <h2>THE FUNERAL OF M. DE BLANCHET.</h2>

    <p>"Never let your husband have a grievance," said Madame
    Marcot, stirring the lump of sugar that she had brought with
    her to put into her cup of tea. "It destroys the happiness of
    the most admirable households. Have you heard of the
    distressing case of the de Blanchets&mdash;Victor de Blanchet
    and his wife?"</p>

    <p>We had not.</p>

    <p>"Very dear friends of mine," said Madame Marcot vivaciously,
    delighted at the chance of an uninterrupted innings, "and
    belonging to a family of the most distinguished. They were a
    truly devoted couple, and had never been apart during the whole
    of their married life. As for him, he was an excellent fellow.
    If he had a fault, it was only that perhaps he was a little
    near; but still, a good fault, is it not? When he was called to
    the Front his wife was desolated, simply desolated. And then,
    poor M. de Blanchet&mdash;<i>not</i> the figure for a
    soldier&mdash;of a rotundity, Mesdames!" And Madame Marcot
    lifted her eyes heavenwards, struck speechless for a moment at
    the thought of M. de Blanchet's outline. "However, like all
    good Frenchmen, he made no fuss, but went off to do his duty.
    He wrote to his wife every day, and she wrote to him.</p>

    <p>"All at once his letters ceased, and then, after a long
    delay, came the official notice, 'Missing.' Imagine the
    suspense, the anxiety! For weeks she continued to hope against
    hope, but at last she heard that his body had been found. It
    had been recognised by the clothes, the identity disc (or
    whatever you call it), and the stoutness, for, alas, the
    unfortunate gentleman's head had been nearly blown away by a
    shell and was quite unrecognisable. Poor Madame de Blanchet's
    grief was terrible to witness when they brought her his sad
    clothing, with the embroidered initials upon it worked by her
    own hand. One thing she insisted on, and that was that his body
    should be buried at A&mdash;&mdash;, in the family vault of the
    de Blanchets, who, as I have said before, are very
    distinguished people. "This meant endless red tape, as you may
    imagine, and endless correspondence with the authorities, and
    delays and vexations, but finally she got her wish, and the
    funeral was the most magnificent ever witnessed in that part of
    the world. You should have seen the '<i>faire part</i>,'" said
    Madame Marcot, alluding to the black-bordered mourning
    intimations sent out in France, inscribed with the names of
    every individual member of the family concerned, from the
    greatest down to <!--page 379 blank-->
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page380"
       id="page380"></a>[pg 380]</span> the most insignificant and
       obscure. "Several pages, I assure you; and everybody came.
       The cort&egrave;ge was a mile long. M. l'Abb&eacute; Colaix
       officiated; there was a full choral mass; and she got her
       second cousin once removed, M. Aristide G&eacute;rant, who,
       as you know, is Director of the College of Music at
       A&mdash;&mdash;, to compose a requiem specially for the
       occasion; and he did not do it for nothing, you may believe
       me. In fine, a first-class funeral. But, as she said, when
       some of her near relations, including her stepmother, who is
       not of the most generous, remonstrated with her on the score
       of the expense, 'I would wish to honour my dear husband in
       death as I honoured him in life.'</p>

    <p>"After it was all over she had a magnificent marble monument
    erected over the tomb, recording all his virtues, and with a
    bas-relief of herself (a very inaccurate representation, I am
    told, as it gave her a Madonna-like appearance to which she can
    lay no claim in real life) shedding tears upon his
    sarcophagus."</p>

    <p>Madame Marcot paused for breath, and, thinking the story
    finished, we drifted in with appropriate comments. But we were
    soon cut short.</p>

    <p>"Ten months afterwards," continued the lady dramatically,
    "as Madame de Blanchet, dressed of course in the deepest
    mourning, was making strawberry jam in the kitchen and weeping
    over her sorrows, who should walk in but Monsieur?"</p>

    <p>"What&mdash;her husband?" cried everybody.</p>

    <p>"The same," answered Madame Marcot. "He was a spectacle. He
    had lost an arm; his clothing was in tatters, and he was as
    thin as a skeleton. But it was Monsieur de Blanchet all the
    same."</p>

    <p>"What had happened?" we shrieked in chorus.</p>

    <p>"What has happened more than once in the course of this War.
    He had been taken prisoner, had been unable to communicate and
    at last, after many marvellous adventures, had succeeded in
    escaping."</p>

    <p>"But the other?" we cried.</p>

    <p>"Ah, now we come to the really desolating part of the
    affair," said Madame Marcot. "The corpse in M. de Blanchets
    clothing, what was he but a villainous Boche&mdash;stout, as is
    the way of these messieurs&mdash;who had appropriated the
    clothes of the unfortunate prisoner, uniform, badges, disc and
    all, in order, no doubt, to get into our lines and play the
    spy. Happily a shell put an end to his activities; but by the
    grossest piece of ill-luck it made him completely
    unrecognisable, so that Madame de Blanchet, as well as the
    officers who identified him, were naturally led into the
    mistake of thinking him a good Frenchman, fallen in the
    exercise of his duty."</p>

    <p>"What happiness to see him back!" I remarked.</p>

    <p>"I believe you," said Madame Marcot, "and touching was the
    joy of M. de Blanchet too, until he observed her mourning. He
    was then inclined to be slightly hurt at her taking his death
    so readily for granted. However, she soon explained the case;
    but, when he heard that a nameless member of the unspeakable
    race was occupying the place in the family vault that he had
    been reserving for himself for years past at considerable cost,
    he became exceedingly annoyed; and when, through the medium of
    his relations, he learned of the first-class funeral, and of
    the oak coffin studded with silver, and the expensive full
    choral mass, and the requiem specially written for the
    occasion, and the marble monument, his wrath was such that in
    pre-war days, and before he had undergone the reducing
    influence of the German hunger-diet, he would certainly have
    had an apoplectic seizure. To a man of his economical turn of
    mind it was naturally enraging. But the thing that put the
    climax on his exasperation was the bas-relief of his wife,
    'ridiculously svelte' as he remarked, shedding tears over the
    ashes of a wretched Boche.</p>

    <p>"The situation for him and for the family generally,"
    concluded Madame Marcot, "is, as you will readily conceive, one
    of extreme unpleasantness and delicacy. The cost of exhuming
    the Hun, after the really outrageous expense of his interment,
    is one that a thrifty man like M. de Blanchet must naturally
    shrink from; indeed he assures me that his pocket simply does
    not permit of it.</p>

    <p>"In the meantime he can never go to lay a wreath upon the
    tombs of his sainted father and mother, or pass through the
    cemetery on his way to mass (he is a good Catholic), without
    being reminded of the miserable interloper and all the
    circumstances of his magnificent first-class funeral. Hence he
    is a man with a grievance&mdash;an undying grievance, I may
    say&mdash;for he is practically certain to have a ghost
    hereafter haunting the spot that ought to be its resting-place
    but isn't. Still, it is <i>chic</i> to have a ghost in the
    family. The de Blanchets will be more distinguished than
    ever."</p>

    <h2>THE MUSINGS OF MARCUS MULL.</h2>

    <h3>(<i>In the manner of an illustrious Mentor</i>.)</h3>

    <h3>I.</h3>

    <p>I noted in last week's issue the persistence of the strange
    story that Mr. <span class="sc">Gladstone</span>, in his wrath
    at his reduced majority in Midlothian, broke chairs when the
    news arrived. I was careful to add that, as the result of
    searching investigation, I was in a position to state that Mr.
    <span class="sc">Gladstone</span> never did any such thing.
    Still I cannot altogether regret having alluded to the story in
    view of the interesting letters on the subject which have
    reached me from a number of esteemed correspondents.</p>

    <h3>II.</h3>

    <p>As an eminent Dundonian divine, who wishes to remain
    anonymous, remarks, it is a melancholy fact that men of genius
    have often been prone to violent ebullitions of temper. He
    recalls the sad case of <span class="sc">Milton</span>, who,
    while he was dictating his <i>Areopagitica</i>, threw an
    ink-horn at his daughter, "to the complete denigration of her
    habiliments," as he himself described it. Yet
    <span class="sc">Milton</span> was a man of high character and
    replete with moral uplift. I remember that my old master,
    Professor Cawker of Aberdeen, once told me that as a child he
    was liable to fits of freakishness, in one of which he secreted
    himself under the table during a dinner-party at his father's
    house and sewed the dresses of the ladies together. The result,
    when they rose to leave the room, was disastrous in the
    extreme. But Professor Cawker, as I need hardly remind my
    readers, was a genial and noble-hearted man. I presented him on
    his marriage with a set of garnet studs. Ever after when I
    dined at his house he wore them. Nothing was ever said between
    us, but we both knew, and I shall never forget.</p>

    <h3>III.</h3>

    <p>My old friend, Lemmens Porter, whose name I deeply regret
    not to have read in the Honours List, reminds me of the painful
    story of <span class="sc">Swinburne</span>, who, in a fit of
    temper, hurled two poached eggs at <span class="sc">George
    Meredith</span> for speaking disrespectfully of
    <span class="sc">Victor Hugo</span>. The incident is suppressed
    in Mr. <span class="sc">Gosse's</span> tactful life, but Mr.
    Porter had it direct from <span class="sc">Meredith</span>,
    whose bath-chair he frequently pulled at Dorking.
    <span class="sc">Swinburne</span> was, I regret to say, pagan
    in his views, but, unlike some pagans, he was incapable of
    adhering to the golden mean. <span class="sc">Aristotle</span>,
    I feel certain, would never have condescended to the use of
    such a missile, and it is beyond "imagination's widest stretch"
    to picture, say, the late Dr. <span class="sc">Joseph
    Cook</span>, of Boston, the present Lord
    <span class="sc">Aberdeen</span>, or the Rev. Dr. Donald
    McGuffin acting in such a wild and tempestuous manner.</p>

    <h3>IV.</h3>

    <p>Still we must admit the existence of high temper even in men
    of high souls, high aims and high achievements. Everyone may
    improve his temper. We cannot all emulate the patience of
    <span class="sc">Job</span>, but we can at least set before us
    the noble example of Professor Cawker, who redeemed the angular
    exuberance of his youth by the mellow and mollifying kindliness
    of his maturity. Even if Mr. <span class="sc">Gladstone</span>
    <i>did</i> break chairs, we should not lightly condemn him. You
    cannot make omelettes without breaking eggs. Besides, chairs
    cannot retaliate.</p>

    <h2>BALLADE OF INCIPIENT LUNACY.</h2>

    <p><i>Scene</i>.&mdash;A Battalion "Orderly" Room in France
    during a period of "Rest." Runners arrive breathlessly from all
    directions bearing illegible chits, and tear off in the same
    directions with illegible answers or no answer at all.
    Motor-bicycles snort up to the door and arrogant
    despatch-riders enter with enormous envelopes containing
    leagues of correspondence, orders, minutes, circulars, maps,
    signals, lists, schedules, summaries and all sorts. The tables
    are stacked with papers; the floor is littered with papers;
    papers fly through the air. Two type-writers click with
    maddening insistence in one corner. A signaller buzzes
    tenaciously at the telephone, talking in a strange language
    apparently to himself, as he never seems to be connected with
    anyone else. A stream of miscellaneous
    persons&mdash;quarter-masters, chaplains, generals, batmen,
    D.A.D.O.S.'s, sergeant-majors, staff-officers, buglers, Maires,
    officers just arriving, officers just going away, gas experts,
    bombing experts, interpreters, doctors&mdash;drifts in, wastes
    time, and drifts out again.</p>

    <p>Clerks scribble ceaselessly, rolls and nominal rolls,
    nominal lists and lists. By the time they have finished one
    list it is long out-of-date. Then they start the next.
    Everything happens at the same time; nobody has time to finish
    a sentence. Only a military mind, with a very limited
    descriptive vocabulary and a chronic habit of self-deception,
    would call the place orderly.</p>

    <p>The Adjutant speaks, hoarsely; while he speaks he writes
    about something quite different. In the middle of each sentence
    his pipe goes out; at the end of each sentence he lights a
    match. He may or may not light his pipe; anyhow he
    speaks:&mdash;</p>

    <h2>THE MUD LARKS.</h2>

    <p>If there is one man in France whom I do not envy it is the
    G.H.Q. Weather Prophet. I can picture the unfortunate wizard
    sitting in his bureau, gazing into a crystal, <i>Old Moore's
    Almanack</i> in one hand, a piece of seaweed in the other,
    trying to guess what tricks the weather will be up to next.</p>

    <p>For there is nothing this climate cannot do. As a
    quick-change artist it stands <i>sanspareil</i> (French) and
    <i>nulli secundus</i> (Latin).</p>

    <p>And now it seems to have mislaid the Spring altogether.
    Summer has come at one stride. Yesterday the staff-cars
    smothered one with mud as they whirled past; to-day they choke
    one with dust. Yesterday the authorities were issuing
    precautions against frostbite; to-day they are issuing
    precautions against sunstroke. Nevertheless we are not
    complaining. It will take a lot of sunshine to kill us; we like
    it, and we don't mind saying so.</p>

    <p>The B.E.F. has cast from it its mitts and jerkins and
    whale-oil, emerged from its subterranean burrows into the open,
    and in every wood a mushroom town of bivouacs has sprung up
    over-night. Here and there amateur gardeners have planted
    flower-beds before their tents; one of my corporals is nursing
    some radishes in an ammunition-box and talks crop prospects by
    the hour. My troop-sergeant found two palm-plants in the ruins
    of a chateau glass-house, and now has them standing sentry at
    his bivouac entrance. He sits between them after evening
    stables, smoking his pipe and fancying himself back in
    Zanzibar; he expects the coker-nuts along about August, he
    tells me.</p>

    <p>Summer has come, and on every slope graze herds of
    winter-worn gun-horses and transport mules. The new grass has
    gone to the heads of the latter and they make continuous
    exhibitions of themselves, gambolling about like ungainly
    lambkins and roaring with unholy laughter. Summer has come, and
    my groom and countryman has started to whistle again, sure sign
    that Winter is over, for it is only during the Summer that he
    reconciles himself to the War. War, he admits, serves very well
    as a light gentlemanly diversion for the idle months, but with
    the first yellow leaf he grows restless and hints indirectly
    that both ourselves and the horses would be much better
    employed in the really serious business of showing the little
    foxes some sport back in our own green isle. "That Paddy," says
    he, slapping the bay with a hay wisp, "he wishes he was back in
    the county Kildare, he does so, the dear knows. Pegeen, too, if
    she would be hearin' the houn's shoutin' out on her from the
    kennels beyond in Jigginstown she'd dhrop down dead wid the
    pleasure wid'in her, an' that's the thrue word," says he,
    presenting the chestnut lady with a grimy army biscuit. "Och
    musha, the poor foolish cratures," he says and sighs.</p>

    <p>However, Summer has arrived, and by the sound of his cheery
    whistle at early stables shrilling "Flannigan's Wedding," I
    understand that the horses are settling down once more and we
    can proceed with the battle.</p>

    <p>If my groom and countryman is not an advocate of war as a
    winter sport our Mr. MacTavish, on the other hand, is of the
    directly opposite opinion. "War," he murmured dreamily to me
    yesterday as we lay on our backs beneath a spreading parasol of
    apple-blossom and watched our troop-horses making pigs of
    themselves in the young clover&mdash;"war! don't mention the
    word to me. Maidenhead, Canader, cushions, cigarettes, only
    girl in the world doing all the heavy paddle-work&mdash;that's
    the game in the good ole summertime. Call round again about
    October and I'll attend to your old war." It is fortunate that
    these gentlemen do not adorn any higher positions than those of
    private soldier and second-lieutenant, else, between them, they
    would stop the War altogether and we should all be out of
    jobs.</p>

    <h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

    <p><i>Tuesday, June 5th</i>.&mdash;In listless and dejected
    mood the House of Commons reassembled after its all-too-brief
    recess. Members collectively missed their
    <span class="sc">Mark</span>, for Colonel
    <span class="sc">Lockwood</span>, the only popular Food
    Controller in history, had been summoned upstairs and left the
    Kitchen Committee to its fate. The shower of Privy
    Councillorships, baronetcies and knighthoods which had
    simultaneously descended upon the faithful Commons afforded
    little compensation for this irreparable loss; and even the
    sight of the <span class="sc">Attorney-General's</span>
    immaculate spats appearing over the edge of the Table was
    insufficient to dispel the prevailing gloom.</p>

    <div class="figright"

        <a href="images/386-1.png"><img width="100%"

        </a><p class="sc">Colonel Lockwood's Farewell to the
        Kitchen on his elevation to the Upper House.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Mr. <span class="sc">Pemberton-Billing</span> made a gallant
    effort to galvanize his colleagues into life. Remembering that
    it was an air-raid that got him into the House&mdash;some
    people will never forgive the Germans for this&mdash;he seldom
    allows a similar incident to pass without endeavouring to
    improve the occasion. As his policy of "two bombs to one"
    failed to intrigue Mr. <span class="sc">Bonar Law</span> he
    sought to move the adjournment, but when the Question was put
    only five Members, instead of the necessary forty, rose in its
    support.</p>

    <p>If Sir H. <span class="sc">Dalziel</span> has his way, and
    the consumer is allowed to purchase his sugar unrefined, the
    British breakfast will become a most exciting meal. Lice,
    beetles and, on one occasion, a live lizard have been found in
    the bags arriving from Cuba. Even with meat at its present
    price, Captain <span class="sc">Bathurst</span> doubts whether
    such additions to our dietary would be really welcome.</p>

    <p>In the pre-historic times before August, 1914, the
    <span class="sc">Postmaster-General</span> was wont to give on
    the Vote for his department a long and discursive account of
    its multifarious activities, and to enliven the figures with
    anecdotes and even with jokes. Mr.
    <span class="sc">Illingworth</span> knows a better way. With
    deliberate monotony he reeled off his statistics to a steadily
    diminishing audience. Only once did he evoke a sign of
    animation. He has abolished the absurd rule that the person
    presenting a five-pound note at a post-office should be
    required to endorse it; and, in defending this momentous
    change, he remarked that he himself had endorsed many such
    notes, "but never with my own name." For a moment Members were
    startled by this cynical admission of something which seemed to
    their half-awakened intelligence very like a confession of
    forgery. But the <span class="sc">Postmaster-General</span>
    soon put them to sleep again, and by nine o'clock had got his
    vote safely through.</p>

    <p><i>Wednesday, June 6th</i>.&mdash;Nothing short of a
    revolution, it was supposed, would cause Whitehall to empty its
    precious pigeon-holes, in which so many millions of pious
    aspirations and abortive complaints sleep their last sleep. But
    the War has penetrated even here, and Mr.
    <span class="sc">Baldwin</span> was able to announce, with a
    cheerfulness that some of the older officials probably regard
    as almost indecent, that already a vast quantity of material
    has gone to the pulping-mill.</p>

    <p>In the course of the debate on the Representation of the
    People Bill, Sir <span class="sc">Frederick Banbury</span>
    explained that he resigned his membership of the
    <span class="sc">Speaker's</span> Conference because he found
    that he and his party were expected to give up everything and
    to get nothing in return. If so the Liberals on the Conference
    were very short-sighted, for a little concession then would
    have saved them a lot of trouble now. What Sir
    <span class="sc">Frederick</span> does not know about the art
    of Parliamentary obstruction is not worth knowing, and he
    evidently means to use his knowledge for all it is worth. He
    even succeeded&mdash;a rare triumph&mdash;in drafting an
    instruction to the Committee which passed the
    <span class="sc">Speaker's</span> scrutiny and took a good hour
    to debate. In vain Sir <span class="sc">George Cave</span> and
    Mr. <span class="sc">Long</span> reminded the House that it had
    already approved the main principles of the Bill. You can't
    ride a cock-horse when <span class="sc">Banbury's</span>
    cross.</p>

             THANK YOU."</p>
    </div>

    <p>Another old hand at the game is Lord <span class="sc">Hugh
    Cecil</span>. His particular grievance against the Bill is, I
    fancy, that it alters the character of his constituency, and,
    should it pass, will oblige him to appeal for the votes of
    callow young Bachelors with horrid Radical notions instead of
    being able to repose in confidence upon the support of a solid
    phalanx of clerical M.A.'s. He possesses also an hereditary
    antipathy to extensions of the franchise. Lord
    <span class="sc">Claud Hamilton</span> must have thought
    himself back in 1867, listening to Lord
    <span class="sc">Cranborne</span> attacking the Reform Bill
    wherewith <span class="sc">Dizzy</span> dished the Whigs. Lord
    <span class="sc">Hugh</span>, like his father, is a master of
    gibes and flouts and jeers, and used most of the weapons from a
    well-stocked armoury in an endeavour to drill a fatal hole in
    the Bill.</p>

    <p>At one moment he chaffed the <span class="sc">Home
    Secretary</span> for seeking to turn the House into a Trappist
    monastery, where Ministers alone might talk and Members must
    obey; at the next he was reminding the House, on a proposal to
    raise the age of voters, that a great many of the persons who
    took part in the massacre of St. Bartholomew were under
    twenty-two years of age. But though Members listened and
    laughed they refused, for the most part, to vote with him. The
    Bill came almost unscathed through the first day of its ordeal
    in Committee.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday, June 7th</i>.&mdash;If all the hundred and
    sixty-eight Questions on the Order Paper had been fully
    answered the German Government would have
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page387"
       id="page387"></a>[pg 387]</span> learned quite a number of
       things that it is most anxious to know, for the Pacifist
       group were full of curiosity regarding the war-aims of the
       Allies. Several of the most searching inquiries had to be
       met by such discouraging <i>formul&aelig;</i> as "I have
       nothing to add to my previous reply," or "The matter is
       still under consideration."</p>

    <p>Mr. <span class="sc">Snowden</span>, however, learned from
    the <span class="sc">Home Secretary</span> that the Government,
    the House and the Country were in full sympathy with the
    war-policy laid down by the French Government, and that we were
    prepared to go on fighting until it was achieved. Here is
    something for his colleagues to tell the Stockholm Conference,
    if they can get there.</p>

    <p>For some occult reason the word "cheese" always excites
    Parliamentary merriment. Mr. <span class="sc">George
    Roberts's</span> announcement that the Board of Trade had made
    arrangements by which a quantity of this commodity would be
    available for public use next week was greeted with the
    customary laughter. Upon Army requirements, he added, would
    depend the quantity to be "released." Colonel
    <span class="sc">Yate</span> was perturbed by this
    Gorgonzolaesque phrase, and anxiously inquired to what species
    of cheese it referred.</p>

    <h2>THE GOD-MAKERS.</h2>

    <p>The financial success of Mr. H.G.
    <span class="sc">Wells</span>' punctuality and enterprise in
    looking into the vexed question of the Deity, even in war time,
    has had the usual effect, and many literary men are feverishly
    pursuing similar studies. In due course some of these will no
    doubt take practical shape. Meanwhile it has seemed desirable
    for a <i>Punch</i> man to make a few inquiries among our
    leading philosophers and readers of the future with regard to
    the same engrossing topic. For England will ever be the wonder
    and despair of other nations in its capacity, no matter with
    what seriousness its hands are filled, for pursuing
    controversial distractions.</p>

    <p>To run Mr. <span class="sc">Arnold Bennett</span> to earth
    was no easy matter, for in these days he is behind every scene,
    and no statesman, however new, can get along without his
    counsel or correction. But, since to the good <i>Punch</i> man
    difficulties exist only as obstacles of which the circumvention
    acts as intellectual cocktails or stimuli, the task was
    accomplished. Mr. <span class="sc">Bennett</span> agreed that
    the book of the other famous Essex fictionist was a meritorious
    and ingenious work, but he found it far from exhaustive. The
    idea of God, he held, still needed handling in a capable
    efficient way. What was wrong with religion was, he said, its
    mystery; if only it could be pruned of nonsense and made
    practical for the man in the street, it might become really
    useful. He personally had not yet thought finally on the
    subject of God, having just now more tasks on hand (including a
    new play and universal supervision) than he could count on the
    Five Fingers, but directly he had time he meant to attend to
    the matter and polish it off. It was a case where his
    intervention was clearly called for, since omniscience could be
    handled only by omniscience.</p>

    <p>The <i>Punch</i> man has, however, to admit himself beaten
    in the matter of Sir <span class="sc">Oliver Lodge</span>. On
    inquiring at Birmingham University he was told that the
    illustrious Principal was absent, no one knew where, but it was
    believed that he was visiting the higher slopes of Mount Sinai.
    All that the <i>Punch</i> man could obtain was one of the black
    velvet skull-caps which the seer wears, but, as it refused to
    give up any of its secrets, he must confess to failure&mdash;at
    any rate until Sir <span class="sc">Oliver</span> returns.</p>

    <p>Being in Brummagem (as it has been wittily called), the
    <i>Punch</i> man bethought him of the Rev. R.J.
    <span class="sc">Campbell</span>, once the very darling of the
    new gods&mdash;in fact the arch neo-theologian. But Mr.
    <span class="sc">Campbell</span>, erstwhile so articulate and
    confident, had nothing to say. All he could do was to lock
    himself for safety in his church and look through the keyhole
    with his beautiful troubled wistful orbs.</p>

    <p>Mr. G.K. <span class="sc">Chesterton</span> loomed up to a
    dizzy height amid a cloud of new witnesses. Greeting the
    <i>Punch</i> man, he laid aside his proofs.</p>

    <p>"I was just deleting the abusive epithet 'Lloyd' from all
    the references to the <span class="sc">Premier</span>," he
    said, "but I have a moment for you. I find a moment sufficient
    time for the assumption of any conviction however
    lifelong."</p>

    <p>The <i>Punch</i> man asked if he had read the Dunmow
    evangel.</p>

    <p>"I have read Mr. <span class="sc">Wells's</span> book,
    <i>God, the Invisible Man</i>, with the greatest interest,"
    said Mr. <span class="sc">Chesterton</span>.</p>

    <p>The <i>Punch</i> man ventured to correct him. "<i>God, the
    Invisible King</i>," he interposed.</p>

    <p>"Very likely," replied the anti-Marconi Colossus. "But
    what's in a title anyway? Books should not have titles
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page389"
       id="page389"></a>[pg 389]</span> at all, but be numbered,
       like a composer's operas, Op. 1, Op. 2, and so on."</p>

    <p>"Whether or not the opping comes, some of them," said the
    <i>Punch</i> man, "are certain to be skipped."</p>

    <p>The giant was visibly annoyed. "You're not playing the
    game," he said. "It's I who ought to have said that. Not you.
    You're only the interviewer. You'd better give it to me
    anyway."</p>

    <p>"And what," the <i>Punch</i> man asked, "are your views
    respecting God?"</p>

    <p>"I consider," he said instantly, "that an honest god's the
    noblest work of man."</p>

    <p>"I felt sure you would," the <i>Punch</i> man replied. "In
    fact, I had a bet on it."</p>

    <p>The Rev. Sir <span class="sc">William Robertson
    Nicoll</span>, Editor of <i>The British Weekly</i>, said that
    for many years his paper had supported Providence, to, he
    believed, their mutual advantage, and it would continue to do
    so. He personally recognised no need for change. Still, no one
    welcomed honest analysis more warmly than himself, and he had
    read Mr. <span class="sc">Wells's</span> masterpiece with all
    his habitual avidity and delight.</p>

    <p>The <i>Punch</i> man, passing on to the office of <i>The
    Times</i>, craved permission to see the Editor, through smoked
    glass if necessary. Having complied with a thousand formalities
    he was at last ushered into the presence. The great man was
    engaged in selecting the various types in which to-morrow's
    letters were to be set up&mdash;big for the whales and minion
    for the minnows. "I can give you just two minutes," he said,
    without looking up. "These are strenuous ti&mdash;&mdash;, I
    should say days. Self-advertisement we leave to the lower
    branches of the family."</p>

    <p>"All I want to know," said the <i>Punch</i> man, "is what is
    your idea of God? The feeling is very general that God should
    be more clearly defined and, if possible, personified. One of
    your own Republican correspondents, who not only got large type
    but a nasty leader, has said so. How do you yourself view
    Him?"</p>

    <p>"I have a god of my own," said the Editor, watch in hand,
    "and I see him very distinctly. Powerfully built, with a boyish
    face and a wealth of fairish hair over one side of the noble
    brow. Aloof but vigilant. Restive but determined. Quick to
    praise but quicker to blame. Adaptive, volcanic, relentless and
    terribly immanent&mdash;terribly. That is my god. A king, no
    doubt, but"&mdash;here he sighed&mdash;"by no means invisible.
    Good day."</p>

    <p>Nothing but the absence of Mr. <span class="sc">Frank
    Harris</span> in what is not only his spiritual but his actual
    home, America, prevents the publication of his definitive and
    epoch-making views on this suggestive theme.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile things go on much as usual.</p>

    <h2>AT THE PLAY.</h2>

    <h3>"<span class="sc">Sheila</span>."</h3>

    <p><i>Mark Holdsworth</i>, a bachelor of middle age, is bored
    with commercial success and seeks a diversion. He would like to
    have a son. And his attractive typist, <i>Sheila</i>, strikes
    his fancy as a suitable medium. On her side the girl (obviously
    recognisable by her innocence as a pre-war flapper) is sick of
    drudgery, longs very simply for the joys of life, as she
    imagines them, meaning freedom and pretty dresses and money to
    spend and piles of invitation cards, and so forth. His proposal
    of marriage, practically the first word he has ever said to her
    outside their business relations, seems to her too good to be
    true. There is no question of a grand passion, not even a
    question of every-day romance. It is just a fair exchange,
    though she is too young to appreciate the man's motives and is
    content with the pride of being his choice and the prospects of
    the wonderful life that opens before her.</p>

    <p>Three months later (they are married and in their different
    ways have grown to care for one another) we find her
    discontented. Her social blunders and the attitude of his
    people have set her on edge, and we are further to understand
    that she is not very responsive to the strength of his feelings
    for her. A bad shock comes when she hears, through a jealous
    woman-friend of his bachelor days, that he has married her for
    the sake of a son. This poisons for her the memory of their
    first union and she refuses to be his wife again.</p>

    <p>An old obligation, entered into before his marriage, compels
    him to go abroad on business where she cannot accompany him. He
    does not know that she is to have a child, and in his absence
    she keeps the knowledge from him. Her boy is born and dies. The
    news, reaching <i>Holdsworth</i> through a brother, brings him
    home, and husband and wife are reconciled. Such is the plot,
    told crudely enough.</p>

    <p>Now, if Miss <span class="sc">Sowerby</span> meant
    deliberately to create a woman who does not really know what
    she wants&mdash;a creature of moods without assignable
    motives&mdash;then I am not ashamed of failing to understand
    her <i>Sheila</i>, since her <i>Sheila</i> did not understand
    herself. But if she is designed to illustrate the eternal
    feminine (always supposing that there is such a thing) then I
    protest that her chief claim to be representative of her sex is
    her unreasonableness. Of course I should never pretend to say
    of a woman in drama or fiction that she has not been drawn true
    to nature. To know one man is, in most essentials, to know all
    men; to know fifty women (though this may be a liberal
    education) does not advance you very far in knowledge of a sex
    that has never been standardized.</p>

    <p>When we first meet <i>Sheila</i> her idea of happiness is to
    spend an evening (innocent of escort) at the picture-palace;
    take this from her and her heart threatens to break. Three
    short months and she has developed to the point of breaking off
    relations with a husband who has given her all the
    picture-palaces she wanted, but has also committed the
    unpardonable indecency of marrying her with the object of
    getting a son!</p>

    </div>

    <p>Here, if she approves the attitude of her heroine, I am
    tempted to argue, in my dull way, with the charming author of
    <i>Sheila</i>. You must always remember that there was no
    love&mdash;not even courtship&mdash;before this betrothal. The
    girl was swept off her feet by the honour done to her and by
    the chance of seeing "life" as she had never hoped to see it.
    The man, on his side, wanted a son. Was his object so very
    contemptible in comparison with hers? Women marry by the myriad
    for the mere sake of having children, and nobody blames them.
    Indeed, we call it, very reverentially, the maternal instinct.
    Well, what is the matter with the paternal instinct?</p>

    <p>However, I am not going to set my opinion up against Miss
    <span class="sc">Sowerby's</span>. Where I can follow her I
    find so much clear insight and observation that I must needs
    have faith in her good judgment where I cannot understand. This
    arrangement still leaves me free to prefer her in her less
    serious moments. Here she is irresistible with that delicate
    humour of hers that is always in the picture and never has to
    resort to the device of manufactured epigram. There is true
    artistry in her lightest touch. Her people are not galvanised
    puppets; they simply draw their breath and there they are. And
    she has the particular quality of charm that makes you yield
    your heart to her, even when your head remains your own.</p>

    <p>How much she owes to Miss <span class="sc">Fay
    Compton's</span> interpretation of <i>Sheila</i> she would be
    the first to make generous acknowledgment. It was an
    astonishingly sensitive performance. Miss
    <span class="sc">Compton</span> can be eloquent with a single
    word or none at all. By a turn of her eyes or lips she can make
    you free of her inarticulate thoughts. I must go again just to
    hear her say "Yes," and give that sigh of content at the end of
    the First Act.</p>

    <p>Mr. <span class="sc">Aubrey Smith</span> as <i>Mark
    Holdsworth</i> had a much easier task, and did it with his
    habitual ease. Mr. <span class="sc">William
    Farren</span>&mdash;a very welcome return&mdash;was perfect as
    ever in a good grumpy part. It was strange to see the gentle
    Miss <span class="sc">Stella Campbell</span> playing the
    unsympathetic character of a jealous and rather cruel woman;
    but she took to it quite kindly. Mr. <span class="sc">Lance
    Lister</span>, as the boy <i>Geoffrey</i>, who kept intervening
    in the most sportsmanlike way on the weaker side and adjusting
    some very awkward complications with the gayest and most
    resolute tact, was extraordinarily good. Admirable, too, were
    Miss <span class="sc">Joyce Carey</span> as a shop-girl friend
    of <i>Sheila's</i> boarding-house period, and Mr.
    <span class="sc">Henry Oscar</span> as her "fate," whose line
    was shirts. The scene in which these two encounter the superior
    relatives of <i>Sheila's</i> husband abounded in good fun, kept
    well within the limits of comedy. It was a pure joy to hear
    <i>Miss Hooker's</i> garrulous efforts to carry off the
    situation with aggressive gentility; but even more fascinating
    was the abashed silence of her young man, broken only when he
    blurted out the word "shirts," and gave the show away.</p>

    <p>The whole cast was excellent, and Sir
    <span class="sc">George Alexander</span> must be felicitated on
    a very clever production. But it is to author and heroine that
    I beg to offer the best of my gratitude for a most refreshing
    evening.</p>

    <h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

    <h3>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks</i>.)</h3>

    <p>When I first read the title of <i>Secret Bread</i>
    (<span class="sc">Heinemann</span>) my idea was&mdash;well,
    what would anyone naturally think but that here was a romance
    of food-hoarding, a tale of running the potato blockade and the
    final discovery of a hidden cellar full of fresh rolls? But of
    course I was quite wrong. The name has nothing to do with food,
    other than mental; it stands for the sustaining idea (whatever
    it is) that each one of us keeps locked in his heart as the
    motive of his existence. With <i>Ishmael Ruan</i>, the hero of
    Miss F. <span class="sc">Tennyson Jesse's</span> novel, this
    hidden motive was love of the old farm-house hall of Cloom, and
    a wish to hand it on, richer, to his son. <i>Ishmael</i>
    inherited Cloom himself because, though the youngest of a large
    family, he was the only one born in wedlock. Hence the second
    theme of the story, the jealousy between <i>Ishmael</i> and
    <i>Archelaus</i>, the elder illegitimate brother. How, through
    the long lives of both, this enmity is kept up, and the
    frightful vengeance that ends it, make an absorbing and
    powerful story. The pictures of Cornish farm-life also are
    admirably done&mdash;though I feel bound to repeat my
    conviction that the time is at hand when, for their own
    interest, our novelists will have to proclaim what one might
    call a close time for pilchards. Still, Miss
    <span class="sc">Jesse</span> has written an unusually clever
    book, full of vigour and passion, of which the interest never
    flags throughout the five-hundred-odd closely-printed pages
    that carry its protagonists from the early sixties almost to
    the present day. No small achievement.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Mrs. <span class="sc">Skrine</span> has collected some
    charming fragrant papers from various distinguished sources
    concerning the ever-recurring phenomenon of <i>The Devout
    Lady</i> (<span class="sc">Constable</span>), in order to
    inspire one <span class="sc">Joan</span>, a V.A.D. heroine of
    the new order. I guess <span class="sc">Joan</span>, of whom
    only a faint glimpse is vouchsafed, must be a nice
    person&mdash;the author's affectionate interest in her is
    sufficient proof of that. I suppose we all know our Little
    Gidding out of <span class="sc">Shorthouse's</span> <i>John
    Inglesant</i>. Mrs. <span class="sc">Skrine</span> deprecates
    the Inglesantian view and offers us a stricter portrait of
    <span class="sc">Mary Collet</span>. "Madam"
    <span class="sc">Thornton</span>, Yorkshire Royalist dame in
    the stormy days of the Irish Rebellion and the Second
    <span class="sc">James's</span> flight to St. Germain, is
    another portrait in the gallery; then there's
    <span class="sc">Patty More, Hannah's</span> less famous
    practical sister, of Barleywood and the Cheddar Cliff
    collieries; and a modern great lady of a lowly cottage, in
    receipt of an old-age pension and still alive in some dear
    corner of England&mdash;the best sketch of the series, because
    drawn from life and not from documents. If the author has a
    fault it is her detached allusiveness, her flattering but
    mystifying assumption that one can follow all her references,
    and her rather mannered idiom: "He proved a kind husband, but
    sadly a tiresome." These, however, be trifles. Read this
    pleasant book, I beg you, and send it on to your own Joan.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>I have read with deep interest and appreciation and with a
    mournful pleasure the <i>Letters of Arthur George Heath</i>
    (<span class="sc">Blackwell</span>, Oxford). It is the record,
    in a series of letters mostly written to his parents, of the
    short fighting life of a singularly brave and devoted man.
    There is in addition a beautiful memoir by Professor
    <span class="sc">Gilbert Murray</span>, whose privilege it was
    to be <span class="sc">Arthur Heath's</span> friend.
    <span class="sc">Heath</span> was not vowed to fighting from
    his boyhood onward. He was a brilliant scholar and afterwards a
    fellow of New College, Oxford. The photograph of him
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page392"
       id="page392"></a>[pg 392]</span> shows a very delicate and
       refined face, and his letters bear out the warrant of his
       face and prove that it was a true index to his character.
       Until the great summons came one might have set him down as
       destined to lead a quiet life amid the congenial
       surroundings of Oxford, but we know now that the real stuff
       of him was strong and stern. He joined the army a day or two
       after the outbreak of war, being assured that our cause was
       just and one that deserved to be fought for. He had no
       illusions as to the risk he ran, but that didn't weigh with
       him for a moment. On July 11th, 1915, he writes to his
       mother from the Western Front: "Will you at least try, if I
       am killed, not to let the things I have loved cause you
       pain, but rather to get increased enjoyment from the Sussex
       Downs or from Janie (his youngest sister) singing Folk
       Songs, because I have found such joy in them, and in that
       way the joy I have found can continue to live?" Beautiful
       words these, and typical of the man who gave utterance to
       them. The end came to him on October 8th, his twenty-eighth
       birthday. His battalion of the Royal West Kent Regiment was
       engaged in making a series of bombing attacks. In one of
       these <span class="sc">Arthur Heath</span> was shot through
       the neck and fell. "He spoke once," Professor
       <span class="sc">Murray</span> tells us, "to say, 'Don't
       trouble about me,' and died almost immediately." His Platoon
       Sergeant wrote to his parents, "A braver man never existed,"
       and with that epitaph we may leave him.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The scenes of <i>A Sheaf of Bluebells</i>
    (<span class="sc">Hutchinson</span>) are laid in Normandy,
    where they speak the French language. But the Baroness
    <span class="sc">Orczy</span> does not take advantage of this
    local habit, and is careful not to put too heavy a strain upon
    the intelligence of those who do not enjoy the gift of tongues.
    "<i>Ma tante</i>," "<i>Mon cousin</i>,"
    "<i>Enfin"</i>&mdash;these are well within the range of all of
    us. Indeed, though I shrink from boasting, I could easily have
    borne it if she had tried me a little higher. "<i>Ma
    tante</i>," for instance, got rather upon my nerves before the
    heroine had finished with it. The plot (early nineteenth
    century) is concerned with one <i>Ronnay de Maurel</i>, a
    soldier and admirer of <span class="sc">Napoleon</span>, and in
    consequence anathema to most of his own family. The heroine was
    betrothed to <i>Ronnay's</i> half-brother, as elegant and
    royalist as <i>Ronnay</i> was uncouth and Napoleonic. It is a
    tale of love and intrigue for idle hours, the kind of thing
    that the Baroness does well; and, though she has done better
    before in this vein, you will not lack for excitement here; and
    possibly, as I did, you will sometimes smile when strictly
    speaking you ought to have been serious.</p>

    <p>"Economy, I hate the word!" said a much-harassed housekeeper
    recently: echoing, I fear, the sentiments of the great majority
    of the British people. Nevertheless, let no one be deterred by
    a somewhat forbidding title from reading Mr.
    <span class="sc">Henry Higgs's</span> <i>National Economy: An
    Outline of Public Administration</i>
    (<span class="sc">Macmillan</span>). Although written by a
    Treasury official&mdash;a being who in popular conception is
    compounded of red-tape and sealing-wax and spends his life in
    spoiling the Ship of State by saving halfpennyworths of
    tar&mdash;it is not a dry-as-dust treatise on the art of
    scientific parsimony, but a lively plea for wise expenditure.
    Mr. <span class="sc">Higgs</span> is no believer in the dictum
    that the best thing to do with national resources is to leave
    them to fructify in the pockets of the
    taxpayers&mdash;"doubtful soil," in his opinion; nor is he
    afraid that heavy taxation will kill the goose with the golden
    eggs. It may be "one of those depraved birds which eat their
    own eggs, in which case, if its eggs cannot be trapped, killing
    is all it is fit for." The author is full of well-thought-out
    suggestions for saving waste and increasing efficiency in our
    national administration. The introduction of labour-saving
    machinery, the elimination of superfluous officials, the
    reduction of the necessary drudgery which too often blights the
    initiative and breaks the hearts of our young civil
    servants&mdash;all these and many other reforms are advocated
    in Mr. <span class="sc">Higgs's</span> most entertaining pages.
    I cordially commend them to the attention of everyone who takes
    an intelligent interest in public affairs, not excluding
    Cabinet Ministers, Members of Parliament, and political
    journalists.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Though already we have so portentous an array of books
    jostling each other upon the warshelf, there must be many
    people who will gladly find the little space into which they
    may slip a slender volume called <i>A General's Letters to His
    Son on Obtaining His Commission</i>
    (<span class="sc">Cassell</span>). So slender indeed is the
    book that by the time you have read the disproportionate title
    you seem to be about halfway through it. But here is certainly
    a case of infinite riches in a little room. The anonymous
    writer is deserving of every praise for the mingled restraint
    and force of his method; you feel that, were the name less
    outworn, he might well have signed himself "One Who Knows," for
    practical experience sounds in every line. Greatest merit of
    all, the letters contrive to handle even the most delicate
    matters without a hint of preaching. But no words of mine
    could, in this association, add anything to the tribute paid in
    a brief preface by so qualified a critic as General Sir H.L.
    <span class="sc">Smith-Dorrien</span>: "If young officers will
    only study these letters carefully, and shape their conduct
    accordingly, they need have no fear of proving unworthy of His
    Majesty's Commission." This is high praise, but well deserved.
    Personally, my chief regret is that so valuable a collection of
    advice should have delayed its appearance so long: there would
    have been use and to spare for it these three years past.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy

entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
